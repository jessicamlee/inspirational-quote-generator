# Inspirational Quote Generator (1st Iteration is Live!)
This inspirational quote generator project is based on freeCodeCamp's Full-Stack Next.js, TypeScript, and AWS Course, guided by [Brian Hough](https://github.com/BrianHHough/inspirational-quote-generator-freeCodeCamp), with quotes provided by [ZenQuotesAPI](https://zenquotes.io/) and hype4academy's [Glassmorphism CSS Generator](https://hype4.academy/tools/glassmorphism-generator).

Check out the live site: [Inspiration Quote Generator](https://prod.d28hmooal1ffyl.amplifyapp.com/) (name to be updated)

☑ In addition to setting up the application, the first iteration included a few priorities I appreciate for an enjoyable user experience: 
- [x] Updated backgrounds for rendered images
- [x] Basic/Necessary Keyboard Accessibility
- [x] Simple styles for a responsive experience

#### ⛳ Features to be updated in the next phase:
- [ ] Expand User Experience (beyond a single-paged and quote generator)

✨ _Stay tuned for the next update!_ ✨


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
